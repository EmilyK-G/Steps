            What was the last time you heard of a schedule?

        </h2>
        <h3>
            Many people try to manage their time at the end of the day. Because when you sit at the sofa, make some tea and grab your favorite book your brain decides it's the perfect time to remind you everything you DIDN'T do... grocery shopping, the dentist appointment, walk the dog, get the cake for tomorrow's party, etc., etc., etc... 
            But the problem is that at the end of the day we are pressured and tired (Even though some people think pressure makes them more efficient, it isn't good for your health) and we simply cannot think of how much we have already done.
            This causes stress and makes your life seem more difficult than how it is.
            <br/>
            Fortunately for us, anxious and slow people, schedules were created a few ceturies ago. Some of us might not be taking advantage of this incredibly usefool tool.
            Well, that ends today...

        A little advice for my fellas that like to think too much about everything that happens in their life... <b>don't</b>. Unnecesary knowledge it's going to slow you down. But of course, don't mind me if you are a secret agent.
        For your mental health and efficiency, keep in mind that <i>you are not ment to understand</i> everything that comes to you. 
        Think about someone in a marathon, if he tries to understand every competitor's speed and backround he won't win.
        You have a goal, set your mind in focus mode and concentrate on whaere <i>you are going</i>.
